                      <p>Separating garbage and recycling reduces waste sent to landfills which help reduce greenhouse gasses as a result. The burning of garbage produces toxic methane (a greenhouse gas) that contributes significantly to our warming climate. Landfills also consist mainly of non-biodegradable waste which slows down the decomposition process even further. Recycling helps limit the amount of waste that is thrown into landfills and is a good way to help reuse the same materials! Recycling also requires much less energy to process the materials rather than virgin materials like wood, metals, waste, etc. Some items and materials that can be recycled include cardboard, plastic, paper, soda cans, glass bottles, and more! Things such as food waste, batteries, paper towels, and styrofoam cannot be recycled.</p>

                    <section id="waterText" class="hidey-bit">
                      <p>One simple way to conserve water is to turn off the sink when brushing your teeth! The conservation of water saves energy, since energy is needed to heat, filter, and pump the water in our homes Turning off the water when you brush your teeth in the morning and at night can save as much as eight gallons of water collectively! This is one of the easiest ways to conserve water and to practice mindful usage. This practice of turning off the sink can also be applied when you are washing the dishes.</p>

            <div class="individual-section" id="composting-section">
                    <button class="button" id="postButton"><h3>Composting</h3></button>
                    <section id="postText" class="hidey-bit">    
                        <p>Food waste contributes to about 8% of greenhouse gas emissions. Half of food waste comes from the food service and households. While reducing food waste in your personal life is ideal, some things will simply not be edible. An easy was to combat food waste ending up in landfills is to start composting at home! Composting is the process of turning organic material, often carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich, into a nutrient-rich fertilizer. Composting not only has benefits to the environment but it is an excellent way to nourish your garden and save money on fertilizers. </p><br>
                        <h3>Industrial Composting vs Home Composting</h3>
                        <p>Industrial composters monitor and manage waste piles and allow for the decomposition of materials that are too difficult to be composted at home. Most facilities will break down their materials in less than 80 days. If industrial composting is available for your area, you will most likely have received a bin for collection to gather organic waste. </p>
                        <p>At home composting is done at a much smaller scale, and often takes a longer process. Still, it is an accessible process for many people. Piles can be kept in bins in shady outdoor areas, or even indoors. </p><br>
                        <h3>Steps for Composting At Home</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Determine your composting site. Be aware that if it is outside, it can attract pests or stain the siding of your house or fences. </li><br>
                          <li>Gather your compositing equipment. You will need a composter (such as a bin, tumbler, or electric composter,) gardening gloves, a bucket for transferring, and a compost thermometer. Additional equipment you may need are a rake and wheelbarrow, if you plan to include yard waste. Composting tumblers may require a compost starter.</li><br>
                          <li>Determine how you will collect your compost materials. Make sure to pick something you can stick with! This can be an outside bin or a transfer container in your kitchen. </li>
                            <ul> 
                              <li>It also doesn not need to be anything fancy or expensive. You can use an old carton.</li>
                              <li>To avoid insects or odors in your kitchen, you can store food scraps in a bag in your freezer or the back of a fridge. </li>
                            </ul><br>
                          <li>Once your collection system is determined, start collecting your materials. You will want to have a mix of two different types of materials. </li>
                            <ul> 
                              <li><b>Brown materials </b>are carbon-rich organic matter. These materials circulate air and absorb moisture. This includes branches, twigs, wood, cardboard, dried grass, egg cartons, old leaves, and sawdust.  Make sure to shred any paper products! </li>
                              <li><b>Green materials </b>are nitrogen-rich organic matter. These materials provide moisture and nutrients and are crucial to microbial growth. This includes food scraps, coffee grounds, untreated grass clippings, fresh leaves, eggshells, and flowers. </li>
                              <li>Keep in mind that there are certain materials you will want to avoid. Meat, dairy products, bones, and cooked, oily, or buttery foods can attract pests. Certain products labeled as “compostable”, like bags and wipes, can only be composted industrially. </li>
                            </ul><br>
                          <li>You will want to have enough material to create 5 to 6 inches of base layers. Make sure to alternate between layers of green materials and brown materials. </li>
                            <ul> 
                              <li>When you start layering, make sure to start by putting the dry brown materials at the very bottom. A balance between layers is crucial, as allowing water and air to flow gives microorganisms a better chance to do their job. Your ratio of brown materials should always be greater than your green materials!</li>
                            </ul><br>
                          <li>Maintain your composting heap! </li>
                            <ul> 
                              <li>You will have to wait for decomposition for two to six months, after which it will take a year for every component to break down. </li>
                              <li>Since composting is an ongoing process, you will want to make sure you are keeping it at a consistent temperature of 140 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (about 60 to 70 Celsius.) Adding brown materials can help cool it down and adding green materials can help warm it back up. Make sure to turn the pile every time you add new material. </li>
                              <li>If the pile feels too dry, water it. If it feels too wet, add brown materials to absorb the moisture and circulate air. </li>
                              <li>Make sure to turn your composting pile, preferably with a stick or a spade, to get air flowing. Once every week or every 10 days is ideal to start with. Use your nose! If it smells bad, like a landfill, it is most likely too wet and requires more brown materials or turning! You will know your pile is decomposing if it has a smell that is woody and earthy with sweet or sour notes. </li>       
                            </ul><br>
                          <li>Use your compost! </li>
                            <ul> 
                              <li>Once your compost is finished and becomes a fluffy, earthy compost you can use it in your garden! </li>
                              <li>If you do not have a garden, you can call your local community garden and see if they accept your compost! </li>
                            </ul><br>    
                        </ol>

                    <button class="button" id="susButton"><h3>Repurposing, Upcycling, and Disposing Clothing Sustainably</h3></button>
                    <section id="susText" class="hidey-bit">
                      <h3>What is Fast Fashion?</h3>
                      <p>Fast Fashion is the fast-paced, unsustainable production of cheap, disposable clothing, often in vast quantities by large companies. It consists of constantly introducing new styles, a fast-paced production, a lower quality of clothing that needs to be discarded sooner, and a high and frequent demand by consumers. While fast fashion produces affordable clothing, it is detrimental to the environment and also affects the people working in or living near garment factories. </p>
                      <p>Aside from having a massive carbon footprint, using billions of cubic meters of water each year, and polluting air and water supplies the fats fashion industry is heavily dependent on synthetic fibers. These materials, like nylon, polyester, and acrylics, are fossil fuel-based, plastic-derived materials. They make up 60% of fabric fibers and every time they are washed they produce microplastics that contaminate oceans. Clothes that are thrown out often contribute to the millions of tons of textile waste in landfills. To produce cheap clothes at such fast rates, fast fashion companies often overwork and underpay their workers. Many of these workers also work in hazardous conditions. </p>
                      <h3>How Can You Shop Responsibly?</h3>
                      <p>Reducing the amount of clothing you buy and being a conscious consumer is the best way to reduce the environmental impact of your fashion choices. </p>
                      <p>Keep these questions in mind when you are shopping: </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Is this item of good quality? Will it fall apart after one or two wears? Consider investing in durable items as your staple pieces! </li>
                          <li>Is this item my style? Does it fit my personality? Will I be comfortable wearing it regularly? </li>
                          <li>How often will I wear this item? Can I use it with multiple outfits? </li>
                        </ul>
                      <p>If it is financially feasible, consider supporting environmentally and socially conscious brands! Sustainable brands will often have their information on their websites. Find brands that stick to their values and clearly list how their materials are sources, who makes their products, and how they are designed and tested for quality. The brands are often more expensive because they provide improved wages and working conditions for workers, as well as improved environmental impacts. If these brands are out of your price range, it may be worth it to wait for sales and clearance events! </p>
                      <p>Thrifting and secondhand shopping is another way to reduce clothing waste. </p>  
                      <p>If you need an article of clothing for a one-time event, consider swapping or borrowing clothes with a friend. </p> 
                      <p>Rewearing what you have is a great way to keep your clothes out of landfills and reduce the amount of clothes you buy. The easiest way to re-wear items is to mix and match them to create multiple outfits. </p> 
                      <p>Your clothes will last much longer if you follow the instructions for care, treat stains, and mend your clothing. If you want to get creative or create unique statement pieces, you can try visible mending! This method uses embroidery to repair clothing with colorful designs and patterns. The goal is to surpass the average two years an article of clothing is supposed to last! </p> 
                      <h3>What Can You Do With Old Clothes?</h3>
                      <h4>Repurpose/Upcycle Clothing</h4>
                      <p>Upcycling your clothes is about taking old or unused items and transforming them into a stylish new piece to reduce waste. This method of repurposing clothing not only promotes sustainability by reducing the need for raw materials and lessening waste, but it is a great way to exercise creativity and artistic expression. </p>
                      <h4>Materials You Can Use to Upcycle: </h4>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Use old clothes. Since the main source for upcycling is existing garments, any worn, outdated, or vintage items work. </li>
                          <li>Any leftover fabric scraps from sewing projects can be repurposed into patches or appliques. </li>
                          <li>Old T-shirts can be cut up into strips for accessorizing. </li>
                          <li>Buttons and zippers from discarded clothing can be used to accessorize upcycled pieces. </li>
                          <li>Old denim, leather, or suede are popular fabrics in upcycling. Pairs of jeans can be transformed into bags, jackets, or pillows. Leather or suede jackets and bags can be turned into patches, wallets, or keychains. </li>
                          <li>Unused scarves and ties can be repurposed into straps, headbands, or belts. </li>
                          <li>Salvaged lace or trims can be used to create collars, cuffs, or hems. Old ribbons can be used in a similar way to make decorative bows, edging, or straps. </li>
                          <li>Sweaters or knits can be unraveled into yarn for knitting or crochet projects. </li>
                          <li>Embroidery can bring to life new garments. </li>
                          <li>Some more unconventional materials are plastic bags, bottle caps, and tabs. These items can create decorative elements for clothing or be used as water-resistant elements for accessories. </li>
                        </ul>
                      <h4>Projects You Can Try: </h4>
                      <p>There is a whole word of diy you can explore online! Here are some ideas for projects you can try at home. </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Dye your clothing a different color. You can find tutorials for tie dyeing, dip dying and fully dying your cltohing with dyes that are safe for fabrics. </li>
                          <li>Patches and embroidery are a great way to repair or cover holes, rips, stains, or any other imperfections in your clothing. </li>
                          <li>Turn your old clothing into a reusable tote bag. This not only minimizes waste created by clothing, but also minimizes waste created by single-use plastic or paper bags. </li>
                          <li>You can cut old clothes up to make them into reusable towels for cleaning. </li>
                          <li>For old clothing that has a lot of fabric, you can make them into throw pillows. </li>
                          <li> Instead of using gift wrapping paper, you can transform your old clothes into a fabric wrap for presents. </li>
                        </ul>
                      <h4>How can you discard clothing responsibly?</h4>
                      <p>Sometimes, you aren't able to salvage or repurpose a clothing item. There are still ways you can discard your garments in a sustainable way! </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>If you are looking to get rid of clothes that are still in good quality, you can consider reselling them! This is an option that allows you to make some money and can help ensure the item goes to someone who will use it. Sites like Depop or Poshmark are good for making sure your item will go to another conscious consumer. </li>
                          <li>If selling your clothes is not an option, but you qould still like your items to be used you can consider swapping or giving them to your loved ones. Your friends or family might consider swapping or accepting clothing. </li>
                          <li>If you're considering donating your clothes, research what local organizations do with donations. Some places you can donate to are non-profit organizations, clothing drives, or thrift stores. Make sure you’re following the instructions for cleanliness and quality, to avoid giving these charities items they cannot actually use. </li>
                          <li>If your items cannot be repaired or reused, you can give them to charities and organizations that recycle fabrics or textiles. </li>
                        </ul>

                    <button class="button" id="energyButton"><h3>Conserving Energy</h3></button>
                    <section id="energyText" class="hidey-bit">
                      <p>There are small everyday actions you can take to reduce the amount of energy your home consumes. These actions not only benefit the environment but can also reduce the amount you spend on power bills. </p>
                      <h3>How To Conserve Energy At Home</h3>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Use Natural Light</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Using natural light is one of the easiest and most intuitive ways to reduce the amount of energy used in your home. Natural light is also beneficial for the brain because it increases serotonin levels! It can be as simple as opening your curtains or using lightweight ones to let sunlight into your room. If you want to increase the use of natural light, you can rearrange the most used areas in your house so that they are filled with sunlight. Remember that windows facing north and south allow for more glancing light that can also produce heat and harsh light. </li>
                          </ul><br>  
                        <li>Turn Off Lights and Devices That Are Not in Use</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Turning off your lights and devices that are not in use is a cost-effective way to reduce the amount of energy you consume. Turning off the light switch when you leave a room is an easy habit to develop. Devices like televisions, computers, video game consoles, and cable boxes should be switched and unplugged completely when not in use. Chargers should also be unplugged since they use small amounts of energy even when they are not charging any devices. Usually, televisions can be programmed to turn off after a certain amount of time so they are not on all night. Similarly, computers can be programmed to be set to sleep or hibernate to conserve energy. </li>
                            <li>There are some appliances and electronics will continue to draw power even when they are not being used. These “energy vampires” can account for 5 to 10% of your power bills. These devices include game consoles, coffee makers, wall chargers, and printers. A way to manage these appliances is by plugging them into a power strip and only turning it on when these devices are being used. Smart or advanced power strips can be scheduled to turn off when these are inactive. </li>
                          </ul><br>
                        <li>Replace Your Lightbulbs</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>A light-emitting diode bulb (LED) is 80 to 85% more energy efficient, has a longer lifetime, and generates less heat than a traditional incandescent lightbulb. Traditional lightbulbs have to be replaced more often than LED alternatives. LED bulbs also exist in many shapes and sizes, so they are likely to fit in most lamps or light fixtures in your home. While LEDs can range in price, they can save over $100 during their lifetime. </li>
                          </ul><br>    
                        <li>Install a Programmable Thermostat</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Controlling the temperature of your home is a great way to ensure you are not using more energy than necessary. A programmable thermostat can reduce energy consumption by 20 to 30% and save you around 8% of your heating and cooling bills. These thermostats can be scheduled to when you are home and keep your house at the best temperatures. </li>
                            <li>Make sure to check the temperature setting on your water heater. If it’s too high, like your tap’s water almost burning your hand,  it can mean that it is working harder than necessary. </li>
                          </ul><br>    
                        <li>Check Your Home’s Insulation</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Air leaks in your home make it harder for HAVC systems to regulate the temperature. To prevent these leaks, it is important to cover any gaps between walls, vents, windows, or doorframes. For gaps in doorframes and windows, there are weather strips or sweeps. For walls or stationary windows, use caulking to seal leaks. </li>
                            <li>Check your basement’s foundations for any cracks that can be sealed with expanding foam. </li>
                            <li>Check the insulation in your attic. Often air leaks from the interior of the home to the attic through ducts, light fixtures, or any small openings. </li>
                            <li>Check the insulation under your floors, your vents, and around your publishing systems, as air can also leak out through these spaces. </li>
                          </ul><br>    
                        <li>Reduce Appliance Use</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Reducing how often you use your appliances can help conserve energy. Try to wash fewer loads of laundry per week and only use your dishwasher when it is full. </li>
                          </ul><br>    
                        <li>Recycle Old Electronics</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>If you are replacing your appliances and electronics, there are sustainable ways to dispose of them. Giving away devices that still work to friends and family is a great way to make sure they will still be used. There are also buy-back programs and in-store recycling programs that will accept devices that work and do not. </li>
                          </ul><br>    
                        <li>Use Renewable Energy</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>If it is financially feasible for you, switch to renewable energy. Renewable power sources include solar, wind, low-impact hydroelectric, or geothermal energy. </li>
                          </ul>    
                      </ol>

            <h1>Insitutitonal Ways</h1>
            <div class="institutional-section" id="voting-section">
                    <button class="button" id="voteButton"><h3>Environmentally Concious Voting</h3></button>
                    <section id="voteText" class="hidey-bit">
                      <p>Voting is essential to a functioning democracy. It allows the public a say in which policies are implemented and who represents them in their government. Voting also allows us to hold our representatives accountable when they do not serve the public’s interests. However, we must acknowledge that environmentally conscious voting cannot happen without removing barriers to voting itself. </p>
                      <p>Tactics like these undermine individual's rights to vote. </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Barriers to eligibility. Qualified voters are often removed from voting lists by tactics such as felon disenfranchisement, restriction times for voter registrations, and voter purges. </li>
                        <li>Barriers to voting. Targeted communities, often where people of color or students live, are faced with more difficulties voting by tactics like removing or limiting early voting, reducing the number of polling places in their area, and stricter voter ID laws. </li>
                        <li>Biased representation. Gerrymandering, the tactic of manipulating the design of legislative districts to gain partisan or racial advantage, reduces the competition of opposition votes and allows policymakers the ability to choose their voters. </li>
                      </ul> 
                     <p>In the context of environmentally conscious voting, this matters because it is often people of color and low-income communities most affected by environmental issues, like air and water pollution that are barred from voting. There tend to be worse health outcomes in states with more restrictive voting policies. Polluting industries are often given permission to continue harming local residents due to these tactics of voter suppression. This disproportionally affects communities of color, as data shows that Black Americans are 75% more likely to live near commercial facilities that produce noise, odor, traffic, or emissions than White Americans. </p>
                     <h3>How Can We Vote With an Environmentally Conscious Mindset? </h3>
                     <h4>Register to Vote </h4>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Making sure you are registered your voice is the first way to make sure your vote counts. Sites like Vote.org and Headcount.org are great resources to search state-by-state deadlines and resources on where to vote. </li>    
                      </ul>
                     <h4>Research Your Candidates </h4>
                       <ul>
                        <li>It is essential to know who you are voting for. Look for politicians with an environmentally friendly platform, especially ones with proof that they stick to it. Use online resources, like Headcount.org, to learn who represents you in local, state, and federal governments. </li>    
                      </ul>
                     <h4>Join Projects That Motivate Voters </h4>
                       <ul>
                        <li>The Environmental Voter Project is an example of such a project. It is a database of voters who are considered to be more likely to prioritize environmental issues, but often do not vote. The goal of the project is to encourage these voters to hit the polls, through text messages, calls, door-to-door canvassing, and more. It also reaches people about local, state, and special elections so that people can continue improving their voting habits. The project does not talk about specific policies or try to reach non-environmentalists on the issues, but instead focuses solely on getting environmentalists to vote. </li>
                        <li>The Sunrise Movement is a similar youth-led project that is aimed towards encouraging younger voters. </li> 
                      </ul><br>

                    <button class="button" id="boyButton"><h3>Boycotting Companies</h3></button>
                    <section id="boyText" class="hidey-bit">
                      <p>Boycotting is the act of withdrawing support from a brand, company, person, organization, etc. as a form of protest due to certain conditions. The aim of boycotting is to disrupt the monetary or social gain of an entity in order for them to change their policies or investments. Institutionally, boycotting is sometimes the only method of resistance available to effect change against the influence that large corporations have on our societal institutions. These corporations rely on the support of the people to grow their power. Therefore, boycotting is an attempt to strip that power and put support on hold or focus it elsewhere.
                        In the scope of climate change, it is vital to withhold support from industries that financially invest in companies actively contributing to the damage of our environment such as fossil fuel energy companies.</p>
                      <p>Part of this lies in doing research on the brands you buy from, sports teams you support, or entertainment subscriptions you pay for and finding where your money really goes. According to the Carbon Majors Report, around 100 companies are responsible for more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Some of the companies that emit the most carbon dioxide include China Coal, Saudi Aramco, Gazprom OAO, and ExxonMobil. Since 1988, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and Chevron have been among the highest-emitting investor-owned companies, accounting for almost 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                      <p>Boycotting as a form of monetary disruption and protest has proven effective in the past. The Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 was a response towards segregation within city buses. This was a pivotal step in the fight for civil rights and ultimately led to institutional change through the Supreme Court implementing anti-segregation laws. More recently, companies like McDonald’s and Starbucks have faced large impacts on sales and customer support due to recent boycotts in response to their financial and political investment towards Israel.</p>

                    <section id="orgText" class="hidey-bit">
                      <p>Joining an organization is a valuable stepping stone in seeking the solution to one’s concerns. There are hundreds of non-profit organizations across the world that address and tackle a multitude of environmental issues but are all driven by the same goal of preserving our World.</p>
                      <p>Environmental solutions are not simple step processes which is why different organizations specialize in different types of organizing.</p>

                      <h4>Research and Education:</h4>

                    <section id="repText" class="hidey-bit">
                      <p>The representatives of your city, town, or county hold power in a multitude of ways to govern your community. They are key in making the voices of their constituents heard and subsequently influence policy reform. These powers, granted by state constitutions, enable them to create and enforce laws, manage public services, regulate local matters, allocate funding for public services and infrastructure projects, etc.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, they have a large influence over local environmental regulations. While federal and state governments set broad environmental policies, local governments are responsible for implementing these policies at the community level. By contacting your local representatives, you can express concern for local environmental issues. You can help shape policies that address change in land usage, construction projects that negatively affect the environment, or sustainable practices. The representatives of your community are the messengers for local concerns to be heard by the state or federal government.</p>
                        <p>There are many ways to contact your representatives. This could include attending public meetings like town halls, public hearings, and city council meetings where local issues are discussed and citizens can express their views directly to their representatives. You could write personalized letters or emails to directly communicate any concerns or suggestions. You could organize or sign petitions to garner community support and stress the importance of your message. You could even take matters to social media for further outreach. Many reps are also quite active on social media due to lobbying practices.</p>
                        <p>If you have concerns about environmental legislation in your area, chances are the people in your community have the same feelings so get out there and make your voice heard!</p>

                    <section id="localText" class="hidey-bit">
                      <p>Supporting local businesses is a crucial step in changing one’s lifestyle to being more environmentally friendly. When buying from a friends’ business, local farm, or street vendor, it offers greater transparency in quality control. You can be more confident that your goods meet strict regional and national standards, unlike items sourced internationally, where manufacturing processes and the presence of harmful preservatives can be less clear.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, sourcing goods locally cuts down on transportation costs. It’s far more fuel-efficient, and consequently results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions. When buying something internationally, your product has to be shipped a long distance. This requires transportation and extra packaging, leading to greater carbon emissions and the use of plastic and other non-recyclable materials. This only ends up right back into landfills. Local products also tend to be fresher, having traveled shorter distances to reach you.</p>
                        <p>Buying locally doesn’t just have environmental benefits but community and individual benefits as well. When supporting a local business, you’re simultaneously supporting your local economy. Your money circulates causing new jobs to be generated or maintained, communities’ revenue to be increased, and families and cultural traditions to receive support. Local businesses also contribute to the tax base through property, sales, and income taxes. This revenue supports public services such as schools, parks, and infrastructure, enhancing the quality of life in one’s community. For individuals, businesses within one’s community are often more catered towards the unique needs and wants of the people. Local customers aren’t just seen as a margin for profit (like from large corporations) but as actual people with lives rooted in the community.</p>
