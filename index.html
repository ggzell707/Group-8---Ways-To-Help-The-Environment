                    <button class="button" id="recycleButton"><h3>Recycling</h3></button>
                    <p id="recycleText">Separating garbage and recycling reduces waste sent to landfills which help reduce greenhouse gasses as a result. The burning of garbage produces toxic methane (a greenhouse gas) that contributes significantly to our warming climate. Landfills also consist mainly of non-biodegradable waste which slows down the decomposition process even further. Recycling helps limit the amount of waste that is thrown into landfills and is a good way to help reuse the same materials! Recycling also requires much less energy to process the materials rather than virgin materials like wood, metals, waste, etc. Some items and materials that can be recycled include cardboard, plastic, paper, soda cans, glass bottles, and more! Things such as food waste, batteries, paper towels, and styrofoam.</p>

                    <p id="waterText">One simple way to conserve water is to turn off the sink when brushing your teeth! The conservation of water saves energy, since energy is needed to heat, filter, and pump the water in our homes Turning off the water when you brush your teeth in the morning and at night can save as much as eight gallons of water collectively! This is one of the easiest ways to conserve water and to practice mindful usage. This practice of turning off the sink can also be applied when you are washing the dishes.</p>
