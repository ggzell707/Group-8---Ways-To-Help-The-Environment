                    <button class="button" id="recycleButton"><h3>Recycling</h3></button>
                    <p id="recycleText">Separating garbage and recycling reduces waste sent to landfills which help reduce greenhouse gasses as a result. The burning of garbage produces toxic methane (a greenhouse gas) that contributes significantly to our warming climate. Landfills also consist mainly of non-biodegradable waste which slows down the decomposition process even further. Recycling helps limit the amount of waste that is thrown into landfills and is a good way to help reuse the same materials! Recycling also requires much less energy to process the materials rather than virgin materials like wood, metals, waste, etc. Some items and materials that can be recycled include cardboard, plastic, paper, soda cans, glass bottles, and more! Things such as food waste, batteries, paper towels, and styrofoam cannot be recycled.</p>

                    <p id="waterText">One simple way to conserve water is to turn off the sink when brushing your teeth! The conservation of water saves energy, since energy is needed to heat, filter, and pump the water in our homes Turning off the water when you brush your teeth in the morning and at night can save as much as eight gallons of water collectively! This is one of the easiest ways to conserve water and to practice mindful usage. This practice of turning off the sink can also be applied when you are washing the dishes.</p>

            <div class="individual-section" id="composting-section">
                    <button class="button" id="postButton"><h3>Composting</h3></button>
                    <section id="postText">    
                        <p>Food waste contributes to about 8% of greenhouse gas emissions. Half of food waste comes from the food service and households. While reducing food waste in your personal life is ideal, some things will simply not be edible. An easy was to combat food waste ending up in landfills is to start composting at home! Composting is the process of turning organic material, often carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich, into a nutrient-rich fertilizer. Composting not only has benefits to the environment but it is an excellent way to nourish your garden and save money on fertilizers. </p><br>
                        <h3>Industrial Composting vs Home Composting</h3>
                        <p>Industrial composters monitor and manage waste piles and allow for the decomposition of materials that are too difficult to be composted at home. Most facilities will break down their materials in less than 80 days. If industrial composting is available for your area, you will most likely have received a bin for collection to gather organic waste. </p>
                        <p>At home composting is done at a much smaller scale, and often takes a longer process. Still, it is an accessible process for many people. Piles can be kept in bins in shady outdoor areas, or even indoors. </p><br>
                        <h3>Steps for Composting At Home</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Determine your composting site. Be aware that if it is outside, it can attract pests or stain the siding of your house or fences. </li><br>
                          <li>Gather your compositing equipment. You will need a composter (such as a bin, tumbler, or electric composter,) gardening gloves, a bucket for transferring, and a compost thermometer. Additional equipment you may need are a rake and wheelbarrow, if you plan to include yard waste. Composting tumblers may require a compost starter.</li><br>
                          <li>Determine how you will collect your compost materials. Make sure to pick something you can stick with! This can be an outside bin or a transfer container in your kitchen. </li>
                            <ul> 
                              <li>It also doesn not need to be anything fancy or expensive. You can use an old carton.</li>
                              <li>To avoid insects or odors in your kitchen, you can store food scraps in a bag in your freezer or the back of a fridge. </li>
                            </ul><br>
                          <li>Once your collection system is determined, start collecting your materials. You will want to have a mix of two different types of materials. </li>
                            <ul> 
                              <li><b>Brown materials </b>are carbon-rich organic matter. These materials circulate air and absorb moisture. This includes branches, twigs, wood, cardboard, dried grass, egg cartons, old leaves, and sawdust.  Make sure to shred any paper products! </li>
                              <li><b>Green materials </b>are nitrogen-rich organic matter. These materials provide moisture and nutrients and are crucial to microbial growth. This includes food scraps, coffee grounds, untreated grass clippings, fresh leaves, eggshells, and flowers. </li>
                              <li>Keep in mind that there are certain materials you will want to avoid. Meat, dairy products, bones, and cooked, oily, or buttery foods can attract pests. Certain products labeled as “compostable”, like bags and wipes, can only be composted industrially. </li>
                            </ul><br>
                          <li>You will want to have enough material to create 5 to 6 inches of base layers. Make sure to alternate between layers of green materials and brown materials. </li>
                            <ul> 
                              <li>When you start layering, make sure to start by putting the dry brown materials at the very bottom. A balance between layers is crucial, as allowing water and air to flow gives microorganisms a better chance to do their job. Your ratio of brown materials should always be greater than your green materials!</li>
                            </ul><br>
                          <li>Maintain your composting heap! </li>
                            <ul> 
                              <li>You will have to wait for decomposition for two to six months, after which it will take a year for every component to break down. </li>
                              <li>Since composting is an ongoing process, you will want to make sure you are keeping it at a consistent temperature of 140 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (about 60 to 70 Celsius.) Adding brown materials can help cool it down and adding green materials can help warm it back up. Make sure to turn the pile every time you add new material. </li>
                              <li>If the pile feels too dry, water it. If it feels too wet, add brown materials to absorb the moisture and circulate air. </li>
                              <li>Make sure to turn your composting pile, preferably with a stick or a spade, to get air flowing. Once every week or every 10 days is ideal to start with. Use your nose! If it smells bad, like a landfill, it is most likely too wet and requires more brown materials or turning! You will know your pile is decomposing if it has a smell that is woody and earthy with sweet or sour notes. </li>       
                            </ul><br>
                          <li>Use your compost! </li>
                          <ul> 
                            <li>Once your compost is finished and becomes a fluffy, earthy compost you can use it in your garden! </li>
                            <li>If you do not have a garden, you can call your local community garden and see if they accept your compost! </li>
                          </ul><br>    
                        </ol>

                    <button class="button" id="susButton"><h3>Repurposing, Upcycling, and Disposing Clothing Sustainably</h3></button>
                    <section id="susText">
                      <h3>What is Fast Fashion?</h3>
                      <p>Fast Fashion is the fast-paced, unsustainable production of cheap, disposable clothing, often in vast quantities by large companies. It consists of constantly introducing new styles, a fast-paced production, a lower quality of clothing that needs to be discarded sooner, and a high and frequent demand by consumers. While fast fashion produces affordable clothing, it is detrimental to the environment and also affects the people working in or living near garment factories. </p>
                      <p>Aside from having a massive carbon footprint, using billions of cubic meters of water each year, and polluting air and water supplies the fats fashion industry is heavily dependent on synthetic fibers. These materials, like nylon, polyester, and acrylics, are fossil fuel-based, plastic-derived materials. They make up 60% of fabric fibers and every time they are washed they produce microplastics that contaminate oceans. Clothes that are thrown out often contribute to the millions of tons of textile waste in landfills. To produce cheap clothes at such fast rates, fast fashion companies often overwork and underpay their workers. Many of these workers also work in hazardous conditions. </p>
                      <h3>How Can You Shop Responsibly?</h3>
                      <p>Reducing the amount of clothing you buy and being a conscious consumer is the best way to reduce the environmental impact of your fashion choices. </p>
                      <p>Keep these questions in mind when you are shopping: </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Is this item of good quality? Will it fall apart after one or two wears? Consider investing in durable items as your staple pieces! </li>
                          <li>Is this item my style? Does it fit my personality? Will I be comfortable wearing it regularly? </li>
                          <li>How often will I wear this item? Can I use it with multiple outfits? </li>
                        </ul>
                      <p>If it is financially feasible, consider supporting environmentally and socially conscious brands! Sustainable brands will often have their information on their websites. Find brands that stick to their values and clearly list how their materials are sources, who makes their products, and how they are designed and tested for quality. The brands are often more expensive because they provide improved wages and working conditions for workers, as well as improved environmental impacts. If these brands are out of your price range, it may be worth it to wait for sales and clearance events! </p>
                      <p>Thrifting and secondhand shopping is another way to reduce clothing waste. </p>  
                      <p>If you need an article of clothing for a one-time event, consider swapping or borrowing clothes with a friend. </p> 
                      <p>Rewearing what you have is a great way to keep your clothes out of landfills and reduce the amount of clothes you buy. The easiest way to re-wear items is to mix and match them to create multiple outfits. </p> 
                      <p>Your clothes will last much longer if you follow the instructions for care, treat stains, and mend your clothing. If you want to get creative or create unique statement pieces, you can try visible mending! This method uses embroidery to repair clothing with colorful designs and patterns. The goal is to surpass the average two years an article of clothing is supposed to last! </p> 
                      <h3>What Can You Do With Old Clothes?</h3>
                      <h4>Repurpose/Upcycle Clothing</h4>
                      <p>Upcycling your clothes is about taking old or unused items and transforming them into a stylish new piece to reduce waste. This method of repurposing clothing not only promotes sustainability by reducing the need for raw materials and lessening waste, but it is a great way to exercise creativity and artistic expression. </p>
                      <h4>Materials You Can Use to Upcycle: </h4>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Use old clothes. Since the main source for upcycling is existing garments, any worn, outdated, or vintage items work. </li>
                          <li>Any leftover fabric scraps from sewing projects can be repurposed into patches or appliques. </li>
                          <li>Old T-shirts can be cut up into strips for accessorizing. </li>
                          <li>Buttons and zippers from discarded clothing can be used to accessorize upcycled pieces. </li>
                          <li>Old denim, leather, or suede are popular fabrics in upcycling. Pairs of jeans can be transformed into bags, jackets, or pillows. Leather or suede jackets and bags can be turned into patches, wallets, or keychains. </li>
                          <li>Unused scarves and ties can be repurposed into straps, headbands, or belts. </li>
                          <li>Salvaged lace or trims can be used to create collars, cuffs, or hems. Old ribbons can be used in a similar way to make decorative bows, edging, or straps. </li>
                          <li>Sweaters or knits can be unraveled into yarn for knitting or crochet projects. </li>
                          <li>Embroidery can bring to life new garments. </li>
                          <li>Some more unconventional materials are plastic bags, bottle caps, and tabs. These items can create decorative elements for clothing or be used as water-resistant elements for accessories. </li>
                        </ul>
                      <h4>Projects You Can Try: </h4>
                      <p>There is a whole word of diy you can explore online! Here are some ideas for projects you can try at home. </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Dye your clothing a different color. You can find tutorials for tie dyeing, dip dying and fully dying your cltohing with dyes that are safe for fabrics. </li>
                          <li>Patches and embroidery are a great way to repair or cover holes, rips, stains, or any other imperfections in your clothing. </li>
                          <li>Turn your old clothing into a reusable tote bag. This not only minimizes waste created by clothing, but also minimizes waste created by single-use plastic or paper bags. </li>
                          <li>You can cut old clothes up to make them into reusable towels for cleaning. </li>
                          <li>For old clothing that has a lot of fabric, you can make them into throw pillows. </li>
                          <li> Instead of using gift wrapping paper, you can transform your old clothes into a fabric wrap for presents. </li>
                        </ul>
                      <h4>How can you discard clothing responsibly?</h4>
                      <p>Sometimes, you aren't able to salvage or repurpose a clothing item. There are still ways you can discard your garments in a sustainable way! </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>If you are looking to get rid of clothes that are still in good quality, you can consider reselling them! This is an option that allows you to make some money and can help ensure the item goes to someone who will use it. Sites like Depop or Poshmark are good for making sure your item will go to another conscious consumer. </li>
                          <li>If selling your clothes is not an option, but you qould still like your items to be used you can consider swapping or giving them to your loved ones. Your friends or family might consider swapping or accepting clothing. </li>
                          <li>If you're considering donating your clothes, research what local organizations do with donations. Some places you can donate to are non-profit organizations, clothing drives, or thrift stores. Make sure you’re following the instructions for cleanliness and quality, to avoid giving these charities items they cannot actually use. </li>
                          <li>If your items cannot be repaired or reused, you can give them to charities and organizations that recycle fabrics or textiles. </li>
                        </ul>
