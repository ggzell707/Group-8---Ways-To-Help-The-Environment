                    <p id="recycleText">Separating garbage and recycling reduces waste sent to landfills which help reduce greenhouse gasses as a result. The burning of garbage produces toxic methane (a greenhouse gas) that contributes significantly to our warming climate. Landfills also consist mainly of non-biodegradable waste which slows down the decomposition process even further. Recycling helps limit the amount of waste that is thrown into landfills and is a good way to help reuse the same materials! Recycling also requires much less energy to process the materials rather than virgin materials like wood, metals, waste, etc. Some items and materials that can be recycled include cardboard, plastic, paper, soda cans, glass bottles, and more! Things such as food waste, batteries, paper towels, and styrofoam cannot be recycled.</p>

                    <p id="waterText">One simple way to conserve water is to turn off the sink when brushing your teeth! The conservation of water saves energy, since energy is needed to heat, filter, and pump the water in our homes Turning off the water when you brush your teeth in the morning and at night can save as much as eight gallons of water collectively! This is one of the easiest ways to conserve water and to practice mindful usage. This practice of turning off the sink can also be applied when you are washing the dishes.</p>

            <div class="individual-section" id="composting-section">
                    <button class="button" id="postButton"><h3>Composting</h3></button>
                    <p id="postText">
                        <p>Food waste contributes to about 8% of greenhouse gas emissions. Half of food waste comes from the food service and households. While reducing food waste in your personal life is ideal, some things will simply not be edible. An easy was to combat food waste ending up in landfills is to start composting at home! Composting is the process of turning organic material, often carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich, into a nutrient-rich fertilizer. Composting not only has benefits to the environment but it is an excellent way to nourish your garden and save money on fertilizers.</p>
                        <h2>Industrial Composting vs Home Composting</h2>
                        <p>Industrial composters monitor and manage waste piles and allow for the decomposition of materials that are too difficult to be composted at home. Most facilities will break down their materials in less than 80 days. If industrial composting is available for your area, you’ll most likely have received a bin for collection to gather organic waste. </p>
                        <p>At home composting is done at a much smaller scale, and often takes a longer process. Still, it is an accessible process for many people. Piles can be kept in bins in shady outdoor areas, or even indoors. </p>
                        <h2>Steps for Composting At Home</h2>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Determine your composting site. Be aware that if it is outside, it can attract pests or stain the siding of your house or fences. </li><br>
                        <li>Gather your compositing equipment. You’ll need a composter (such as a bin, tumbler, or electric composter,) gardening gloves, a bucket for transferring, and a compost thermometer. Additional equipment you may need are a rake and wheelbarrow, if you plan to include yard waste. Composting tumblers may require a compost starter.</li><br>
                        <li>Determine how you will collect your compost materials. Make sure to pick something you can stick with! This can be an outside bin or a transfer container in your kitchen. </li>
                         <ul> 
                          <li>It also doesn’t need to be anything fancy or expensive. You can use an old carton.</li>
                          <li>To avoid insects or odors in your kitchen, you can store food scraps in a bag in your freezer or the back of a fridge. </li>
                         </ul><br>
                        <li>Once your collection system is determined, start collecting your materials. You’ll want to have a mix of two different types of materials. </li>
                         <ul> 
                          <li><b>Brown materials</b> are carbon-rich organic matter. These materials circulate air and absorb moisture. This includes branches, twigs, wood, cardboard, dried grass, egg cartons, old leaves, and sawdust.  Make sure to shred any paper products! </li>
                          <li><b>Green materials</b> are nitrogen-rich organic matter. These materials provide moisture and nutrients and are crucial to microbial growth. This includes food scraps, coffee grounds, untreated grass clippings, fresh leaves, eggshells, and flowers. </li>
                          <li>Keep in mind that there are certain materials you’ll want to avoid. Meat, dairy products, bones, and cooked, oily, or buttery foods can attract pests. Certain products labeled as “compostable”, like bags and wipes, can only be composted industrially. </li>
                        </ul><br>
                      <li>You will want to have enough material to create 5 to 6 inches of base layers. Make sure to alternate between layers of green materials and brown materials. </li>
                        <ul> 
                          <li>When you start layering, make sure to start by putting the dry brown materials at the very bottom. A balance between layers is crucial, as allowing water and air to flow gives microorganisms a better chance to do their job. Your ratio of brown materials should always be greater than your green materials!</li>
                        </ul><br>
                      <li>Maintain your composting heap! </li>
                        <ul> 
                          <li>You will have to wait for decomposition for two to six months, after which it’ll take a year for every component to break down. </li>
                          <li>Since composting is an ongoing process, you’ll want to make sure you’re keeping it at a consistent temperature of 140 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (about 60 to 70 Celsius.) Adding brown materials can help cool it down and adding green materials can help warm it back up. Make sure to turn the pile every time you add new material. </li>
                          <li>If the pile feels too dry, water it. If it feels too wet, add brown materials to absorb the moisture and circulate air. </li>
                          <li>Make sure to turn your composting pile, preferably with a stick or a spade, to get air flowing. Once every week or every 10 days is ideal to start with. Use your nose! If it smells bad, like a landfill, it’s most likely too wet and requires more brown materials or turning! You’ll know your pile is decomposing if it has a smell that is woody and earthy with sweet or sour notes. </li>       
                        </ul><br>
                      <li>Use your compost! </li>
                        <ul> 
                          <li>Once your compost is finished and becomes a fluffy, earthy compost you can use it in your garden! </li>
                          <li>If you don’t have a garden, you can call your local community garden and see if they accept your compost! </li>
                        </ul><br>    
                        </ol>
